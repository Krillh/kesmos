# What Is kesmos?

This project is WIP, and not in release.

Kesmos will be a graphing calculator inspired some by Desmos (hence, the name).
In fact, the whole point of the project is to make a more performance minded
alternative to Desmos where some issues like lack of complex number support can
be mitigated by it being open-source.

Kesmos' reads in a dsl (domain specific language) and parses it into a multiple
expression trees for each statement and then the expression for that variable is
simplified as much as possible. A variable to be solved is then specified and
then solved for.
